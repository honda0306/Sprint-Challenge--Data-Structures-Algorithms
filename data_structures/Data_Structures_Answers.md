Add your answers to the questions below.

    What is the runtime complexity of your depth_first_for_each method? Runtime complexity = O(n) This is because the recursive function is looking over each node only once.

    What is the space complexity of your depth_first_for_each function? Spacetime complexity = O(n) A linear quantity of function calls indicates a linear complexity.

    What is the runtime complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method? Runtime complexity = O(n) The design of this algorithm is similar to depth_first_for_each.

    What is the space complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method? Spacetime complexity = O(n) I'm going out on a limb to assume that generally runtime and spacetime complexity are similar within a given function.

    What is the runtime complexity of your heapsort function? Runtime complexity = O(n log(n))

    What is the space complexity of the heapsort function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array? Spacetime complexity = O(n)
