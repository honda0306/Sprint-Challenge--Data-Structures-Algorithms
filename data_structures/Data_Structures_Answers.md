Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
Runtime complexity = O(n)
This is because the recursive function is looking over each node only once.

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
Spacetime complexity = O(n)
A linear quantity of function calls indicates a linear complexity.

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
Runtime complexity = O(n)
The design of this algorithm is similar to depth_first_for_each.

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
Spacetime complexity = O(n)
I'm going out on a limb to assume that generally runtime and spacetime complexity are similar within a given function.


5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
Runtime complexity = O(n log(n))

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
Spacetime complexity = O(n)
