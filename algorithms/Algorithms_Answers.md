Exercise 1:
    a) O(n ^ 3)
    b) O(log n)
    c) O(sqrt n)
    d) O(n ^ 2)
    e) O(n ^ 3)
    f) O(n)
    g) O(n)
Exercise 2:
    a) 
    b)# Go to the middle drop an egg
        # If it breaks:
        # If it doesn't break:
Exercise 3:
    a) O(n ^ 2) because all comparisons are done between two numbers with each recursive iteration starting from the bottom and rolling up over each element. I think...
    b) I suppose that it would be O(log n) because separating the list by the median element makes the recursive calls deal with only half of the list.
